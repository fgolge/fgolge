Hi. I am Fatih Gölge, currently undergraduate Astronautics Engineering student at Istanbul Technical University.
My aim is to become a gamedeveloper. I intend to use my engineering knowledge through game development projects.
I plan to use my repository for prototypes and sample scenes I will create for my future games.
They can be considered as part of my CV.

For my published games:
